## Car DashBoard Uses

- Displaying bits of information to the driver.
- Speed and RPM display.
- Concise area for having an all-in-one spot for the driver to keep track of their car.
- Easy to read for quick access to car info.
- A display for warning lights and anything wrong with the vehicle.
- Can display mileage and length of trips ( in certain model cars)

### Controls
- Turn Signal controls are typically controlled by a handle next to the wheel.
- Hazard lights are controlled by a single button that will turn on all lights on the dash.
- On some car models, there is usually a button for controlling volume that is either on the front of the wheel or behind it.
- Some modern cars have a directional pad on the wheel that lets you modify some options that display on the dash.
